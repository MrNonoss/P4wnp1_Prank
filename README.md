# P4wnp1_Prank
Yes, this is the revenge repo !! |^v^|

I had a computer-revenge to take on a teammate.
What better tool than the awesome <url=https://github.com/RoganDawes/P4wnP1_aloa>P4wnP1_aloa</url> to accomplish it.

My goal is to disturb him. I don't want to destroy is computer, so there will be no meterpreter, no malware, no password exfiltration, etc...
But... There might be some if he responds back ^^

I decided to split the script in 7 parts, the 00 one is the whole pack.
Why splitting? I noticed that on the same machine, the "keyboard" does not act always the same way, from time to time, it's malfunctionning. Splitting the script allows to proceed with the next step without carring about the failure of the previous one.

Let's speak of what we are going to do... Please note that everything here will be layout("fr") and that it works on the may 2020 windows 10 update;

# 00_godsWrath_jeremPrank
This one is a set of the most efficient pranks, set in just one script.

# 01_DisableWinDef_JeremPrank
Pretty self explanatory, this will use keyboard to self disable Winbdows Defender (Why? We never knows...)

# 02_ModMouse_JeremPrank
This will use the keyboard to change mouse options.
It will make it very big and pink. It will also invert mouse pads and scroll.

# 03_BigText_JeremPrank
Here, we will make the text size bigger.

# 04_FullSound_JeremPrank
Here, we will set sound to full.

# 05_UglyTheme_JeremPrank
One of the best part, I created an "ugly theme".
This script will download it from my personnal server, on his computer, and set it to default
This theme include wallpaper, sound theme, color, etc...

# 06_BurstFiles_JeremPrank
Also a big anoyance, this one will set an infinite loop of file creation on the desktop.
In other words, in a few minutes, the hard drive will be full of empty 3Mo files saying "do_Not_Fuck_With_Me.XX"
